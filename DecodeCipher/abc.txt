Question 
Hi. I'm trying to do remote debugging of a java application in NB 6.5. After attaching a debugger every breakpoint icon turns to a split pink square, and for every one i get the following message: Not able to submit breakpoint LineBreakpoint MyClass.java : 2611, reason: No executable location available at line 2611 in class MyClass.. The same happens for every line i try to set up a breakpoint in. 

Can someone help me?.

i have to deal with the issue alot; 

if you have muliple projects open with the same class names -- i do 
sometimes when 
working on multiple revisions -- you have to make sure you set the break 
point 
in the correct file that is actually deployed; ie -- in the correct project; 

you can alsoo if you want make sure all projects with the dups you dont want 
to access are closed to help. 


also -- you have to make sure under windows/debugging/sources that your 
source 
root is also enabled; sometimes it automatically gets enabled, sometime you 
specifically have to add the source root and enable it with the checkbox

also make sure you have compiled with debugging enabled 
usually project/properties/build/compiling/generate debugging info checkbox

I was able to get past this issue by closing my project, shutting down Netbeans, launching Netbeans, opening my project, then doing a clean and build. Now I can set breakpoints in my code.

Is it this issue? 

http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=115033 

If so, it will be fixed in 6.7.1 (to be released at the end of July).
